<!-- ### Goals

Signal Study

- Reproduce cut-flow and efficiencies of the standard MET>200 analysis
- Remove MET>200 cut, then check which kinematic effects are changed:
  - Impact on LLP pT, and LLP energy (gen-level)
  - Change in Cluster efficiency
  - Change in ClusterSize shape
  - Change in deltaPhi (MET , cluster) distribution
  - What’s the MET distribution after requiring at least one cluster with clusterSize > 200 (or whatever passes the trigger)
  - What’s the fraction of events with CSC-CSC, DT-CSC, a single CSC cluster only
  - Plot distribution of cluster ID cut variables ( NStation, MaxStation ) -->

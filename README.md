### Goals ####
Signal Study
* Reproduce cut-flow and efficiencies of the standard MET>200 analysis
* Remove MET>200 cut, then check which kinematic effects are changed:
  * Impact on LLP pT, and LLP energy (gen-level)
  * Change in Cluster efficiency
  * Change in ClusterSize shape
  * Change in deltaPhi (MET , cluster) distribution
  * What’s the MET distribution after requiring at least one cluster with clusterSize > 200 (or whatever passes the trigger)
  * What’s the fraction of events with CSC-CSC, DT-CSC, a single CSC cluster only
  * Plot distribution of cluster ID cut variables ( NStation, MaxStation )
